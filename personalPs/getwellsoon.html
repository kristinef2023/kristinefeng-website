            In this piece, I am addressing the unemployment crisis and the overwhelming challenges faced by the lower and middle class, where many individuals are overworked and juggling multiple jobs that lack fulfillment just to make ends meet. Constantly multitasking, they find themselves wanting to pursue more meaningful work while managing their current responsibilities, often neglecting personal and creative pursuits because they don’t always pay well. My aim is to reach students about to enter the workforce and those already in jobs they dislike, challenging them to reflect on their "in between jobs" and how they often remain in these roles due to a lack of security, despite the instability they can bring. This cycle leads to an endless means of survival without true fulfillment. I want to emphasize the need for systemic changes that improve job quality and availability, raising awareness of these hidden struggles and inspiring conversations about creating a more equitable job market.

            Imagine a greeting card that acknowledges the sickness of this issue, a reminder that we will almost never "get well" if we remain trapped in this endless cycle. We often find ourselves expected to perform our tasks even when we’re sick, pressured to push through rather than take the time to heal. Each day spent in a job that fails to fulfill us is another day away from the vibrant lives we deserve. The infinity sign in the word "soon" symbolizes this never-ending struggle, highlighting the urgency for change. The stripes that may seem cute on the surface also speak to how we can feel like prisoners to this system, confined by circumstances that stifle our potential. Those who are privileged enough to earn more often suggest that if we simply gave up small pleasures, we could all be richer. Yet, it is these little trinkets, as represented in the photo, that help keep our mentality healthy within this system. It’s time to confront this reality and advocate for change, allowing ourselves and future generations to find true wellness through meaningful work.
