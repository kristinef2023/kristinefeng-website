            In this piece, I aim to highlight the societal pressures in America that compel us to perform at our best, even when unwell, for companies that can easily replace us. Many individuals find themselves trapped in unfulfilling jobs, caught in a cycle of survival that stifles personal growth and fulfillment. This reality affects not only our well-being but also our potential.

            <br><br>
            Inspired by vintage greeting cards and the overworked horses of Central Park, I confront a stark truth: we often glorify the grind while ignoring its toll. Just as these horses endure endless labor, many employees are pressured to sacrifice their well-being for productivity. The infinity sign in "soon" serves as a reminder of this ongoing struggle and the urgent need for change. The stripes symbolize the confinement we feel within a system that limits our potential. While some suggest sacrificing small joys for greater rewards, greeting cards—often dismissed as a “waste of money”—embody the little pleasures that keep us grounded. 

            <br><br>
            I want to engage students entering the workforce and those in "in-between" roles, encouraging reflection on the insecurities that tether them. We must advocate for systemic changes that improve job quality and availability, raising awareness of these hidden struggles to inspire conversations about a more equitable job market. It’s time to confront this reality and create a future where meaningful work is accessible to all.
