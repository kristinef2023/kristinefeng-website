            In this piece, I aim to highlight the societal pressures in America that compel us to perform our best, even when unwell, for companies that can easily replace us. Many individuals dedicate their lives to unfulfilling jobs, trapped in a cycle of survival that leaves little room for personal growth or fulfillment. I want to engage students entering the workforce and those stuck in these “in-between” roles, encouraging them to reflect on the insecurity that keeps them tethered. This cycle not only hinders well-being but also stifles potential. 

            <br><br>
            Advocating for systemic changes to improve job quality and availability is crucial. By raising awareness of these hidden struggles, we can inspire conversations about creating a more equitable job market. We must confront the reality that dedicating our lives to work that fails to fulfill us perpetuates dissatisfaction. Together, we can work towards a future where meaningful work is accessible to all.

            <br><br>
            Imagine a greeting card that acknowledges the sickness of this issue, a reminder that we will almost never "get well" if we remain trapped in this endless cycle. We often find ourselves expected to perform our tasks even when we’re sick, pressured to push through rather than take the time to heal. Each day spent in a job that fails to fulfill us is another day away from the vibrant lives we deserve. The infinity sign in the word "soon" symbolizes this never-ending struggle, highlighting the urgency for change. The stripes that may seem cute on the surface also speak to how we can feel like prisoners to this system, confined by circumstances that stifle our potential. 

            <br><br>
            Those who earn more often suggest that giving up small pleasures could make us all richer. While this card might be seen as a “waste of money,” it represents the small joys in life that help keep us sane within this system. It’s time to confront this reality and advocate for change, enabling ourselves and future generations to achieve true wellness through meaningful work.
